Story goals:
- Diverge from D&D/LotR high fantasy tropes
- Multiple classes for "players" to choose
- Four factions that any player can get behind to work on
- Still a dungeony realm that people can dive into

Factions:
1. Automata
    - Steampunk beings, whirring gears and hissing gaskets
    - Powerful close range fighters?
2. Quadrapeds?
    - Animal beasts, always with four legs
    - Elemental powers at a distance? Effective healers?
